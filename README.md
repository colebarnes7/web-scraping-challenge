# web-scraping-challenge
This repository contains all the programs and files necessary to scrap data pertaining to the planet Mars and then use Flask and MongoDB to convert this data into a webpage. The jupyter notebook file included is the test file where the scraping program was developed. It was later converted into a python file (scrape_mars.py) and called in app.py to pull all the necessary data into MongoDB. An html index file was then used to pull the data out of MongoDB and display on a webpage.
